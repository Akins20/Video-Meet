 Authentication Flow Plan
User Journey:
Landing Page → Registration/Login → Dashboard → Create/Join Meeting → Meeting Room

Protected Routes:
- All routes except auth and public meeting pages require authentication
- Token refresh handling for expired sessions
- Logout across all tabs/windows
8. Development Phases
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

Project setup with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind
Authentication system (login, register, logout)
Basic routing and protected routes
Redux store configuration
API client setup with RTK Query

Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)

Dashboard with meeting management
Meeting creation and joining
Basic WebRTC implementation (1-on-1)
Socket.IO integration for real-time updates
Meeting controls (mute, video toggle)

Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Weeks 5-6)

Multi-participant support (up to 6 users)
Chat system during meetings
Screen sharing
Meeting settings and preferences
User profile management

Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Weeks 7-8)

UI/UX improvements and animations
Performance optimization
Error handling and edge cases
Testing and bug fixes
Mobile responsiveness

9. Key Integration Points with Backend
API Endpoints to Implement:

Authentication: /api/v1/auth/*
Meetings: /api/v1/meetings/*
Participants: /api/v1/participants/*

Socket.IO Events:

Meeting join/leave events
WebRTC signaling (offer/answer/ICE candidates)
Chat messages
Participant media state changes

Data Flow:
Frontend → API calls → Backend
Frontend ← Socket.IO events ← Backend
Frontend ↔ WebRTC P2P ↔ Other Clients

Next Steps Recommendation

Start with Phase 1: Set up the basic Next.js project structure
Implement Authentication: Connect to your existing auth endpoints
Build Dashboard: Create the meeting management interface
Add WebRTC: Implement basic video calling functionality
Enhance Features: Add advanced features incrementally
